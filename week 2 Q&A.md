# How would you explain the concept of an information system to a friend or family member?

I would like to explain like: It is an interconnected set of components used to collect, store, process and transmit data and digital information. At its core, it is a collection of hardware, software, data, people and processes that work together to transform raw data into useful information. 

Such as laptops, databases, networks, and smartphones are examples of information systems.

# In the five primary components of an information system (hardware, software, data, people, processes), which is the most important for the success of a business?

I think the most important part of IS components is human element. The people that are needed to run the system and the procedures they follow so that the knowledge in the huge databases and data warehouses can be turned into learning that can interpret what has happened in the past and guide future action.

# Do you agree that we are in a post-PC stage in the evolution of information systems? What might business computing look like in the future?

In my opinion, cell phones are only better than computers in terms of size and convenience, computers will never be replaced, computers will be optimized to be smaller and smaller, but there is a limit, it's impossible to be as small as a cell phone and still have great computing power, at least I don't think it's possible on Earth.

# How has Walmart continued to use information systems to maintain its leadership as the worldâ€™s top retailer?

Wal-Mart uses data mining in numerous ways, from demand forecasting to predicting the number of cashiers needed at a store at a particular time. To help suppliers become more efficient, and as a result lower prices, Wal-Mart shares data with them.
