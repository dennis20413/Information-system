## Overview
Networking and communication play a crucial role in modern technology, enabling devices, systems, and people to stay connected. From sending emails to streaming videos, the essence of today's digital world lies in how effectively networks communicate.

This document covers the basics of networking, its components, and some common communication protocols.

## 📡 Key Components of a Network
1. **Nodes**: Devices like computers, servers, or smartphones that communicate on the network.
2. **Links**: The connections between nodes, which can be wired (Ethernet cables) or wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
3. **Switches and Routers**:
   - **Switches**: Connect devices in the same network.
   - **Routers**: Connect different networks together.
4. **Protocols**: Rules that govern communication between devices, such as:
   - HTTP/HTTPS
   - TCP/IP
   - FTP/SFTP
5. **Network Topologies**:
   - Star
   - Mesh
   - Ring
   - Bus

## 🌐 Common Communication Protocols
| Protocol | Purpose                             | Example Use Case           |
|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| HTTP/HTTPS| Web browsing and secure transactions | Accessing websites         |
| FTP      | File transfer                       | Uploading files to a server |
| TCP/IP   | Fundamental internet communication  | Sending data packets       |
| SMTP     | Email sending protocol              | Sending emails             |
| DNS      | Resolves domain names to IP addresses | Typing `google.com` in a browser |

## 📊 Example: How Data Travels Across a Network

### Step 1: Request Initiation
When you type a URL into your browser, the request is sent to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.

### Step 2: Routing
Once the IP address is found, the request is routed to the target server via multiple nodes.

### Step 3: Response
The server sends the requested data (e.g., a webpage) back to your device.
